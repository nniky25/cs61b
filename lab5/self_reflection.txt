You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:I made the logic by myself, without help form AI.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:I add a lot if-else statements.And actually, I can make it not too tedious, I should merge the two 'if statements' of 'if (length < capacity').

A:nothing.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:How to implement Deque, I know it for long time age, and I felt it was mysterious.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:nothing

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A:How to implement sentinel, and should I add it as my first Node.
